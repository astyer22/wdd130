    <h2>Austin Styer</h2>
    <p>Hey guys, my name is Austin Styer and I am originally from Louisville Kentucky but currently live in Rexburg, Idaho. I have been married for 4 years and currently only have 1 child, her name is Esther and she is around 16-17 months old.  I want to learn everything possible regarding web development and how to effectively style the web page so that those viewing can easily understand it and enjoy. </p>
