        <p>"So, I saw something big and hairy walking on two feet out back from where I live, just east of Pine, AZ. I don’t want any of attention, but thought y’all might be able to shed some light on what is here.
        It was about 7’ tall, bipedal and was covered with long brownish red hair.   I saw it at about 5:30-6:00 am walking a short distance on the forest service fence behind the garage where I live. I didn’t go out and look for evidence, and am kicking myself in the butt. It was just walking along, sort of parallel to a game trail."

        <p> "I have had several encounters over the years one of my closest ones happened while I was a police officer another officer and myself were way out in the county one night sitting on our hoods talking about where to set up a roadblock when we heard something coming through the woods toward us as we both turned to look it came off a bluff and landed in the road just in front and to the right of us it stood about 10 foot tall and was big it looked at us and we looked at it what seemed like minutes but was just seconds and it took off in the woods with a loud inhuman scream needless to say we both got in our cars and moved to another location"

        "I moved here in 1994, the day things started happening was about 2007 before I figured it all out. I was out back on a little road feeding wild birds when the neighbor’s dog came running down the road. They stopped and looked back at the way they came, suddenly they started barking. I figured it was the deer, then I looked to the left of the field and then came a big grey upright bigfoot. It came out of the woods, crossed the field and dirt road, and then went into the woods on the other side.
        Later one night I saw him looking in my back glass door. It sent cold chills up my spine."
