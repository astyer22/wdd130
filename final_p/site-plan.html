        "What is Bigfoot?" <br>
        "Bigfoot or also known as Sasquatch is an undocumented, elusive humanoid creature believed to inhabit various wilderness areas, primarily in North America. Despite being known for its purported large size, hairy appearance, and bipedal gait scientist, enthusiasts, and the everyday individual have failed in capturing a live specimen or undoubted video or photo evidence." <br> <br>

        "Historical Background" <br>
        "Through out the recorded time of North American history there have been varying depictions of encounters with this creature. Among Canada's First Nations people, there are traditions and oral histories of encounters with a large, ape-like creature known by various names, including Sasquatch. These stories predate European contact and continue to be part of cultural narratives." <br> <br>

        "Native Art and Totem Depictions" <br>
        "Some native art, totem poles, and carvings from different regions depict figures resembling large, hairy, and humanoid beings, which some interpret as representations of Bigfoot-like creatures." <br> <br>

        "Explorers' Journals" <br>
        "European explorers and settlers in North America recorded encounters or interactions with what they described as wild, hairy, or "giant" men. For example, in 1811, explorer David Thompson noted large footprints in the Rocky Mountains that he attributed to a large, unknown animal." <br> <br>

        "Roosevelt relayed the trapper's story about an enormous and powerful creature known to the locals as the "bauman" or "mountain devil." According to the trapper, Bauman and his partner were attacked by this mysterious being. Bauman's partner was killed, allegedly by the creature. Roosevelt described the tale as an eerie and unnerving encounter with a massive, savage, and unknown creature dwelling in the remote wilderness." <br> <br>
