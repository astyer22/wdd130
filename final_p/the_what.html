        <p>Bigfoot or also known as Sasquatch is an undocumented, elusive humanoid creature believed to inhabit various wilderness areas, primarily in North America.

        <p>European explorers and settlers in North America recorded encounters or interactions with what they described as wild, hairy, or "giant" men. For example, in 1811, explorer David Thompson noted large footprints in the Rocky Mountains that he attributed to a large, unknown animal.</p>

        <p>Roosevelt relayed the trapper's story about an enormous and powerful creature known to the locals as the "bauman" or "mountain devil." According to the trapper, Bauman and his partner were attacked by this mysterious being. Bauman's partner was killed, allegedly by the creature. Roosevelt described the tale as an eerie and unnerving encounter with a massive, savage, and unknown creature dwelling in the remote wilderness.</p>
